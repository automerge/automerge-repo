## Development workflow

Prerequisites:

- pnpm

To install dependencies and build the packages run:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Note: You need to build the packages before running the demo apps.

### Running the demo apps

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Running tests

Currently tests require Node 20 and don't run on Node 22.

```sh
pnpm test
```
