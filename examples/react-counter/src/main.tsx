// We run the network & storage in a separate file and the tabs themselves are stateless and lightweight.
// This means we only ever create one websocket connection to the sync server, we only do our writes in one place
// (no race conditions) and we get local real-time sync without the overhead of broadcast channel.
// The downside is that to debug any problems with the sync server you'll need to find the shared-worker and inspect it.
// In Chrome-derived browsers the URL is chrome://inspect/#workers. In Firefox it's about:debugging#workers.
// In Safari it's Develop > Show Web Inspector > Storage > IndexedDB > automerge-repo-demo-counter.
